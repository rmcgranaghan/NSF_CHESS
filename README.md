# The Sun-to-Power Grid System and an Open Knowledge Network and Community to improve grid resilience

This repository holds resources related to the National Science Foundation (NSF) [Convergence Accelerator](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/index.jsp) project: [The Convergence Hub for the Exploration of Space Science (CHESS)](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/Award%20Listings/Track%20A%20Abstracts/A-7152-McGranaghan-ASTRA.pdf) and the subsequent NSF-funded workshop: "[Simulating Space Weather Extremes: A Workshop to Identify Research Needs to Improve Power Grid Resilience to Geomagnetic Activity](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/NSF_CHESS/blob/master/Simulating%20Space%20Weather%20Extremes%20Summary.pdf)."

Included: 
- (in Presentations directory) Presentation and corresponding resources given by Principal Investigator Ryan McGranaghan to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on March 18, 2020 (note the zip file containing the figures for the Python Notebook is [stored in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JkLruiVbadWIpFWraoPoTvkckoVViRC0) due to file size limitations)
- (in OpenKnowledgeNetwork directory) Script to triplify CHESS data and explore the graph DB
