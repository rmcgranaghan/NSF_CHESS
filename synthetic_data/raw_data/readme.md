2003.asc is the raw data file obtained for 2003 from the NASA OMNI website. It contains high resolution (5 minute) geophysical information as observed by the ACE spacecraft.

The data was then structured into a netCDF file ('OMNI_2003_2003_high_5min_resolution.nc') for further use

The Kp, F10.7, SN and other values were obtained from  ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107
