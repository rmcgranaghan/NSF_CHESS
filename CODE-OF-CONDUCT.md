    - Any other dimension of diversity


### Our Standards
#### Behavior
- Be Respectful
- Be Direct but Professional
- We are likely to have some discussions about criticisms that are respectful and those that are not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
- Be Inclusive
- Understand Different Perspectives
- Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences
- Lead by Example
