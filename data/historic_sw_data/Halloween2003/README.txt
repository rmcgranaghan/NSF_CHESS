These data were provided by Gabor Toth with the following notes: 

I am attaching the Halloween storm input file IMF.dat (I donâ€™t know where the Workshop Github is, but it can be put there). This is combined from two satellites. The original ACE plasma observations were completely flawed due to instrument issues, and should not be used at all for this event. This is input already propagated to 32Re upstream of Earth. The F10.7 is taken to be 275.4. I also attach the Dst (actually SYM-H) that we use for evaluation.

Using real time ACE/DSCOVR data is more realistic than using Level 2 data. On the other hand, using bad data without any filtering is not giving much useful information. I did work on various filtering algorithms that can eliminate some spurious measurement errors, but this workshop may not want to spend much effort on this aspect. We can always try both.
