Dear User,

This data is provided by:

This dataset is now being updated by the National Geophysical
Data Center on a monthly basis.  The Gottingen Kp/Ap values are
usually received one month after after the end of the reporting 
period.  For example, data for November 1994 was received at the end 
of December, 1994. These files will be updated periodically with 
the final sunspot numbers when available.

The KP1994 file was used as an interim measure until the original 
dataset was updated.

In February 1994 the Institut fuer Geophysik ported the programs for
calculating and plotting of Kp and derivated values to a different computer
system. Due to different compilers the calculation program was treated
differently and the transition tables for seasonal changes were not applied
properly. The affected times are

                       Feb 14 - Mar 15, 1994
                       Apr 16 - May 15, 1994
                       Aug 17 - Sep 15, 1994
                       Oct 17 - Nov 15, 1994
                       Feb 14 - Feb 28, 1995.

During these times, some of the published Kp values differ by the value of
one third from the proper values (3+ instead of 3o, for example). The
differing Kp values will also affect the ap, Ap and Cp/C9 values. In some
cases, the ranking of the most quiet and most disturbed days may change.

New Kp/Ap files will now be given version numbers so users can be sure
they have the latest version, ie 1994.v2.
