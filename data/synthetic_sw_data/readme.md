As part of the CHESS workshop, we will be simulating a space weather event. We model this event on the 2003 Halloween storm, and first obtain the relevant "ground truth" data for that time period

We obtain our initial ground truth data from the [NASA OMNI database](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html)

<!-- <<<<<<< HEAD -->

This provides hourly measurements of relevant geophysical quantities. In order to move towards minute resolution data that can be provided to numerical models for pursposes of the workshop, we work from the following data:

- [Solar Wind Data](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/omni/high_res_omni/sc_specific/ace_min_b2003.txt)


- [Kp, Ap and F10.7 index](ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/GEOMAGNETIC_DATA/INDICES/KP_AP)


- [AE index (hourly)](ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/GEOMAGNETIC_DATA/INDICES/AURORAL_ELECTROJET)
