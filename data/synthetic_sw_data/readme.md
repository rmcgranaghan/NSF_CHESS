As part of the CHESS workshop, we will be simulating a space weather event. We model this event on the 2003 Halloween storm, and first obtain the relevant "ground truth" data for that time period

We obtain our initial ground truth data from the [NASA OMNI database](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html)
