These data are those that were created for and used by the publication: Ngwira, C. M., Pulkkinen, A., Kuznetsova, M. M., and Glocer, A. (2014), Modeling extreme “Carrington-type” space weather events using three-dimensional global MHD simulations, J. Geophys. Res. Space Physics, 119, 4456– 4474, doi:10.1002/2013JA019661.


NOTES FOR THE FILE 'Ngwira_synthetic_storm.txt'
Note from Chigo: These data are *not* modeled after Halloween 2003 storm. The data is a mixed of synthetic and observations. I pieced together data from different storms and scaled up the amplitudes of the parameters. Date for 2003 is only used for the purpose of F10.7. As of February 2022 these data have not been used in a publication and are in the process of being explored.
