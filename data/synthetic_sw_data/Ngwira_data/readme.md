These data were created by Chigo Ngwira. 

Note from Chigo: These data are *not* modeled after Halloween 2003 storm. The data is a mixed of synthetic and observations. I pieced together data from different storms and scaled up the amplitudes of the parameters. Date for 2003 is only used for the purpose of F10.7.
