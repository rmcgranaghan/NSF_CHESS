## How to contribute?

---

#### Understanding *where* to contribute
This repository (and the Helio-KNOW project) has many facets. We attempt to categorize the directions for development into several categories:
- OpenKnowledgeNetwork: development that helps create the Sun-to-Power Grid system knowledge graph/network
- Tutorials: Jupyter notebooks or other executable code that teaches an important component of the Sun-to-Power Grid system
- StoryMaps: Inspiring, immersive stories by combining text, interactive maps, and other multimedia content.
- utils: General utilities for data accumulation, wrangling, and analysis
- figures: figures used in various scripts in the directory
- Presentations: PDFs or PPTXs that are related to the Sun-to-Power Grid system

These categories will remain fluid and you are welcome to suggest a change to the existing categories (create [an issue](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/issues)) or suggest creating an entirely new one (create [a discussion topic](https://github.com/rmcgranaghan/Helio-KNOW/discussions) for the community to converse about the addition).
